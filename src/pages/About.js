      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div>
        Hey there! I'm Nya, an Atlanta, GA native who's always had a love for
        numbers and science. I have a solid foundation in biology and a
        comprehensive Full Stack Web Development certificate. My journey has
        been a fusion of scientific exploration and coding expertise, making me
        a dynamic candidate for data analyst roles.

        Armed with a B.S. in Biology from Clayton State University, I've
        ventured into the realm of data analysis through an intensive Full Stack
        Web Development bootcamp at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My
        analytical skills, honed in the biological sciences, have seamlessly
        translated into the world of data, where I've mastered statistical
        analysis using tools such as Excel and Google Sheets functions.
      </div>
      <div>
        My technical toolkit includes SQL, where I'm well-versed in joins and
        queries, as well as JavaScript and some Python. This proficiency extends
        to extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets, a skill crucial
        for any data analyst role.

      <div>
        The three-month bootcamp not only showcased my ability to swiftly learn
        and apply new concepts but also highlighted my collaborative nature.
        With over 20 homework assignments and three collaborative projects, I've
        honed my skills in working effectively within a team to achieve
        data-driven goals.

        Outside the realm of data, you'll find me immersed in a good book,
        experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or indulging in my love
        for travel. These passions not only enrich my life but also contribute
        to my ability to think creatively and approach problem-solving with an
        open mind.
