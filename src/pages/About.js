          Hey there! I'm Nya, an Atlanta, GA native who's always had a love for
          numbers and science. I have a solid foundation in biology, a
          comprehensive Full Stack Web Development certificate, and Data Analyst
          experience. My journey has been a fusion of scientific exploration and
          coding expertise, making me a dynamic candidate for data analyst
          roles.

          Armed with a <span className="span-bg">B.S. in Biology</span> from
          Clayton State University, I've ventured into the realm of data
          analysis through an intensive{" "}
          <span className="span-bg">Full Stack Web Development</span> bootcamp
          at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My analytical skills, honed in
          the biological sciences, have seamlessly translated into the world of
          data, where I've conquered statistical analysis using tools such as{" "}
          <span className="span-bg">Excel and Google Sheets functions.</span>
        </div>
        <div className="p-2">
          My technical toolkit includes <span className="span-bg">SQL</span>,
          where I'm well-versed in joins and other queries, as well as{" "}
          <span className="span-bg">JavaScript</span> and some{" "}
          <span className="span-bg">Python</span>. This proficiency extends to
          extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets, a skill crucial
          for any data analyst role.

        <div className="p-2">
          The three-month bootcamp not only showcased my ability to swiftly
          learn and apply new concepts but also highlighted my collaborative
          nature. With over 20 homework assignments and three collaborative
          projects, I've honed my skills in working effectively within a team to
          achieve data-driven goals.

          in the kitchen, whipping up delightful baked treats, or creating
          content. However, my true passion lies in exploring new horizons
          through travel, where I find inspiration and broaden my perspective.
